    "#  Better Buy: A Comprehensive Comparison Tool for Investors\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Better Buy\" is an interactive model I've created that performs joint analysis and comparisons of two tech companies' business strategies, stock performances, and growth opportunities and recommends the better stock to investors. This model also provides users with detailed visualizations of key growth, performance, and risk metrics to base their decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project I chose to use pandas and SciPy as well as matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization. The financial strength analysis and valuation portions borrow data from Yahoo Finance through yfinance, while the \"Company and Stock Growth\" Section uses data I manually gathered from the Shopify and Amazon Quarterly Reports. The \"Business Strategy\" Section utilizes evidence I've manually obtained from reading expert analysis articles and customer sentiment of both companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "My model draws its name from the weekly/daily articles published by Motley Fool and featured on Forbes and Yahoo Finance. This project was also inspired by a talk titled \"Data Science & The Future of Investing\" given at Domino's REV 2 Conference. \n",
    "\n",
