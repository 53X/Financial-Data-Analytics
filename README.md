# Financial-Data-Analytics
This repository contains my portfolio of investment and finance-related data science projects. These projects are written and presented as Jupyter Notebooks (Python 2.7), and all data used were accessed on Yahoo Finance through the yfinance library. 

All of the following projects were coded and tested through the Domino Data Lab platform (https://www.dominodatalab.com). I chose to use Domino because the platform allows for easy access to Jupyter notebooks, a built-in terminal, and offline scheduling of jobs for periodic regulation of stock prices.

[Risk/Return Analysis and Predictions for 'FAANG' Stocks](https://github.com/quinamatics/Financial-Data-Analytics/blob/master/Risk%20Analysis%20of%20Tech%20Stocks.ipynb)
  * Here I used pandas Dataframe to represent adjusted closing prices and compute moving averages, daily returns, and associated risk of 'FAANG' tech companies.
  * Created visual representations of comparative daily returns and single-stock analysis using Matplotlib, as well as more complex heatmaps and distribution plots using Seaborn. 
  * Compared and plotted risk of investment between simple return analysis techniques and Monte-Carlo simulations.
