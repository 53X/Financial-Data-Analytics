# Financial-Data-Analytics
This repository contains my portfolio of investment and finance-related data science projects. These projects are written and presented as Jupyter Notebooks (Python 2.7), and all data used are available through Yahoo Finance. 

All of the following projects were coded and tested through the Domino Data Lab platform (https://www.dominodatalab.com). The Domino platform allows for easy access to Jupyter notebooks, a built-in terminal, and offline scheduling of jobs perfect for periodic regulation of stock prices.
